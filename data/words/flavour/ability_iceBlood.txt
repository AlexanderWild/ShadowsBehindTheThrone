ABILITY_ICE_BLOOD
Sin pollutes the blood, robbing it of its life. As the shadow falls across the soul, it drains the afflicted. In this case, the warmth of the life force is sapped so completely the sun itself withers, and the days grow cold as the sin kills the world around it. Driven by dark powers, this corruption spreads to all who share the blood, ruining the lands the sinful nobles once ruled.
