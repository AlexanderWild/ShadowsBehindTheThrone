ABILITY_DOCTOR_SOW_CORPSEROOT
The corpseroot is a necrotic plant. Instead of the light of the sun, the plant feeds on all life, draining it. Animals feel uneasy, and flee. Humans feel a sense of dread, a slow slipping away of their vital essence. Creatures with lesser life, plants and fungi, die rapidly. This interrupts the passage of death into new life, and keeps bodies from decaying. They lie in heaps, dead eyes staring, unable to return back to the Earth which gave them life.
