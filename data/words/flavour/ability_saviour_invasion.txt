ABILITY_SAVIOUR_INVASION
In their darkest hour, when all hope seemed lost, and the monsters were at their gates, a saviour arrived. Shining in the sun, their silver armour reflecting its brilliance, and shining from within, they revealed the secret to defeating the terrifying enemy, and rallied the people to drive back the horrors. The people fell to the knees in gratitude, praising whatever deity sent the angel of salvation their way.
