The demagogue ensures there is always an enemy for the people to hate. The peoples' fears and dreads are reduced by the flames of anger and hate, and you profit well from directing them towards your enemies. Whether these enemies are the people's actual enemies are irrelevant. The people are to be lead like cattle, not treated like equals.
