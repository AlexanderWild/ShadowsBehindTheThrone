ABILITY_VAMP_INSANITY
The mind of a vampire is more powerful than that of the humans they consume, granted unholy power by the lives they take. This power can crush the sanity of those weak of mind. Suffers will become obsessive, frightened by unseen eyes, and habitually pick insects from the walls to consume, as the vampire exerts their will over them.
