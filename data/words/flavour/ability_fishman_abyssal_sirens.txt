ABILITY_FISHMAN_ABYSSAL_SIRENS
As the people's madness increases, their dreams are invaded by visions of the abyssal plane, far beneath the ocean, where the sun's light cannot reach. Strange, lights flicker from blasphemous creatures. First nightmares, these dreams soon become cravings, as the humans long to join those beneath the waves. The nobility will never join them, but will fall under the shadow none the less, regardless of how much they fight it.
