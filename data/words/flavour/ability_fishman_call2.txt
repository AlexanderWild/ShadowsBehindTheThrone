ABILITY_FISHMAN_CALL
Dreams of drowing, first horrific, then seductive, afflict those living under the effects of the spell. At first they wake screaming, after visions of being sucked beneath the black waves. Towards the end, they scream when they realise they are still on the land. Eventually, they walk to the beach, step into the waves and never return.
