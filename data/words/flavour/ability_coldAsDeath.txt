ABILITY_COLD_AS_DEATH
The wind shrieks as it rips through the land. Freezing with snow and ice, it is like a thousand knives in the face of any who venture out into the blizzard. Far more terrible still, though, is that its shrieking is the voices of the dead. Survivors of battle hear their fallen comrades, their voices now the howling of the winds which bring the dread winter.
