SET_CHURCH
A major site of worship, a complex of buildings, dedicated to praise of Gods long since silent, if indeed they ever spoke. Around this holy place, the mundanities of human existence continue. The worshippers require shelter and food, and despite the supposed reverence, drink and gambling are ever present.
