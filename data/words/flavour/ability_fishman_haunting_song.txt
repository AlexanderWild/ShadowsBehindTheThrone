ABILITY_FISHMAN_HAUNTING_SONG
The unearthly singing, rising from beneath the waves and growing with the tides, is maddening. It never stops, and can never be blocked out, even by full deafness. The sounds are inhuman, and the words familiar yet unintelligible. To listen for too long will reduce any human mind to ruins, and the victims cannot stop listening.
