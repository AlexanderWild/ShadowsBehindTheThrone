req|lord_lightbringer
This is a city of lights, powered by faith and devotion, ritual and prayer. The stone itself shines, the plants grow stronger, the shadow is driven back, from body and soul. This domain is under the command of a lightbringer noble, who has undergone the dangerous and agonising ritual to turn themselves into a being of light, a pact made to defend their soul against the dark.
The citizens bask in this light, and gain strength from its warming glow.
