The shadows are deep here, and leave only reluctantly when a candle is lit. The moon seems to give no light at all, each night an inpenetrable black miasma. This settlement is highly contaminated by the dark powers, but is not entirely overcome. The citizens themselves are affected, so cannot see the darkness for what it is, but an outsider from a city which has yet to fall so far could easily see the signs.
