req|disease
Disease flourises in this city, the air is tinged with a special kind of fear, that of a death which cannot be seen, which strikes without mercy or reason, which brings a slow end.
The citizens check themselves constantly for the first signs, dreading every cough, reading the signs of their end in every sneeze.
