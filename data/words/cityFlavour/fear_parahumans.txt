req|fear_parahumans
Parahumans. Twisted mutants, which were once human, at some point in their lives or ancestory. Their bodies altered, their minds warped, their souls tainted by dark forces. Whatever they are, whatever they want, they are omens of ill news. This city hums with fear of them, out of fear of their actions and out of fear of joining their ranks.
