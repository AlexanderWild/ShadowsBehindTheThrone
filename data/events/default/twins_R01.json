It seems unconcerned, to have been amputated from the cat itself, and jumps down, stalking across the floor and then bounding to a shadow of a cupboard nearby. While this amuses the twins greatly, it leaves the certainty of there being a cat without a shadow somewhere in the court, which will alert suspicion of not discovered.",
